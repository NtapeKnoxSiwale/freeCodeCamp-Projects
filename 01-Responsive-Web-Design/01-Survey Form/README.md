# freeCodeCamp-Survey-Form-Project

The Copperbelt University Clinic COVID-19 Survey form for the freeCodeCamp Project.

I was given a form to fill out before getting my COVID-19 shot and I figured it would be great if the survey process would be done online. To prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This form is not affliated with the Copperbelt University Clinic.
