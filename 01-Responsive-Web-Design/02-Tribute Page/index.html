          When the mirror is broken you no longer see your image. On that
          dreadful day that you departed this world to join the angels it has
          not been the same again for me.
        </p>
        <p class="tribute">
          Daddy you were the mirror at which I looked at my life, the mirror at
          which I looked at myself and now that you are gone my life is so empty
          that I feel it in my soul. My solace is the fact that you live a
          righteous life. Every moments of your life is like a book on a path
          towards heavenly bliss.
        </p>
        <p class="tribute">
          Daddy when I close my eyes the image of you is all I see… The summary
          of our togetherness from cradle to your exit lingers on my mind it's a
          memory that even death cannot erase… Your departure has made me broken
          and transformed me into a man. Not by gender but by willingness to do
          what great men do knowing that death is the end of every mortal. The
          transformation that life is vain and everything in it is vanity.
        </p>
        <p class="tribute">
          This death won't separate us as I would soon grow old and exit just
          like you did and we meet again soon to continue as father and son.
          Then my son also would pay tribute to me like I am doing this morning
          to your blessed memory.
